The sql table consist of three tables
registered_users: account address, is_registered
aadhar_info: name, aadhar_no, email, phoneno, gender, DOB, is_registered
registration: first_name, last_name, email_address, gender, password, confirm password
Speciality of this project is no votes are being stored in the database rather variables are created in solidity adding them in mapping data structure to store which candidate
aquires how many votes.
Metamask is important for this project make sure to use Ganache to create sample blockchain and then import account addresses to make transactions.
Conditions will only meet when the transactions are being completed.
